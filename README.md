This project focuses on predicting student final grades by analyzing various demographic, social, and academic factors that influence learning outcomes. After preprocessing the dataset—handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables—the data was used to train several machine learning models including Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, SVR, and LogisticRegression. These models were evaluated using regression and classification metrics such as R², RMSE, MAE, accuracy, and F1 score. The results reveal the most important predictors of academic success, such as prior grades, study time, and attendance. The project demonstrates how machine learning can support educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early and improving academic planning and intervention strategies.
